            <p>Hi {{ username }},</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, your item <strong>{{ item_name }}</strong> has been recalled by <strong>{{ store_name }}</strong> for the following reason:</p>
            <p><strong>{{ recall_reason_title }}</strong>: {{ recall_reason_description }}</p>
            <p>Please visit the store within 7 days to collect your item. If you do not collect it within this timeframe, a storage fee of <strong>Â£{{ storage_fee }}</strong> will be applied.</p>
            <p>A member of staff will be able to help you find your item. Showing your <a href="{{ item_page_url }}">item page</a> as proof of the listing may be helpful.</p>
            <p>We understand this might be disappointing, but we believe in second chances. Maybe your next listing will be the one!</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to contact our support team.</p>
