            <h2>Item is No Longer Available for Pickup</h2>
            <p>We wanted to let you know that your item, <strong>{{ item_name }}</strong>, was not collected from <strong>{{ store_name }}</strong> within the 14-day collection period. As a result, it’s now marked as <strong>abandoned</strong>, and ownership has been transferred to the store.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this means you can no longer claim or retrieve the item.</p>
            <p>We understand this might be disappointing, but we're here to help you with your future listings! If you have any other items you'd like to sell, feel free to list them again. Just remember to keep an eye on your collection deadlines to avoid this happening in the future.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, our support team is always here to help you out. Don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
            <p>Best,<br />The Tag&Take Team</p>
